            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my LinkedIn profile! I'm Omid Khan, a dedicated and results-driven data engineer with a strong background in Computer Science and a deep passion for leveraging technology to drive actionable insights from data. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from California State University, East Bay, where I excelled in courses like Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, and Object-Oriented Programming. This robust education has equipped me with a versatile skill set, enabling me to tackle complex data engineering challenges with confidence.</p>

            <p>At Agile Datapro, I have been at the forefront of cutting-edge projects that are reshaping the telecom industry. Leveraging Python, SQL, and Power BI, I develop predictive models that empower major telecom clients to make informed decisions, optimize resources, and drive strategic execution. Among my notable achievements, I set up and configured a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance, utilizing PostgreSQL for processing static data for a telco company. Additionally, I developed and deployed comprehensive Power BI dashboards that provide network analysis, incident severity, root causes, recommendations, and valuable insights. I also integrated a ChatGPT chatbot within the Power BI environment, enabling interactive data exploration and analysis for users. Leveraging data visualization techniques using Power BI, I present complex network data in a way that facilitates comprehensive decision-making.</p>

            <p>Collaboration is at the heart of my approach. I thrive in cross-functional environments and work closely with network engineers and business stakeholders, understanding their requirements and translating them into actionable insights and data-driven solutions. I believe in fostering innovation and driving success through data engineering.</p>

            <p>Beyond my core focus on data engineering, I have a strong interest in the Internet of Things (IoT). My passion for emerging technologies drives me to explore new frontiers and apply them to real-world challenges. I am committed to ethical practices and data privacy, and I lead by example, advocating for transparency and accessibility in technology.</p>

            <p>If you're seeking a dedicated data engineer who can turn complex data into actionable insights and drive innovation, I would be thrilled to connect with you. Let's explore how my skills in data engineering can contribute to your organization's success and help you unlock the full potential of your data-driven initiatives. Together, let's embrace the power of data to shape a brighter future.</p>
